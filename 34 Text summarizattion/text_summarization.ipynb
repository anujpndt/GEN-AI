Today, it is indeed a thanks giving occasion. I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8. Connectivity for societal transformation, \\n \\n9. Defending the nation: Our pride and \\n \\n10. Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products.

He expresses gratitude to the people of India and those living abroad for the opportunity to work with them for the past five years. He shares his experiences and key takeaways from his tenure, which are summarized into 10 important messages:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Accelerate development through the aspirations of the youth.\n",
      "2. Empower villages.\n",
      "3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness.\n",
      "4. Focus on \"Seed to Food\" for agricultural growth.\n",
      "5. Defeat problems and succeed.\n",
      "6. Overcome problems through partnership.\n",
      "7. Show courage in combating calamities.\n",
      "8. Foster connectivity for societal transformation.\n",
      "9. Defend the nation.\n",
      "10. Launch a youth movement for a Developed India 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "He recalls a question from a young girl, Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation by 2020. He assures her that it's a thoughtful question and assures her that efforts are being made to achieve this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker appreciated the question, calling it thoughtful, and assured the person that their dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and worked on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech discusses the aspirations of Indian youth to live in a developed and prosperous India. The speaker highlights the need to empower villages and mentions their visit to Nagaland, where they saw a prospering village with empowered council members making decisions. The speaker emphasizes the importance of physical connectivity through quality roads for villages to thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also talks about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's \"Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas\" (PURA) complex, which aims to provide physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivities to 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. The complex includes healthcare centers, primary to post-graduate education, and vocational training centers, resulting in large-scale employment generation and creation of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the success of the Periyar PURA (Participatory Urban Rural Action) project, which has generated employment and created entrepreneurs through the support of 1000 self-help groups. The project has transformed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land, allowing villagers to grow Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, generate power using biomass, and process food. The project has also established marketing centers, providing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the speech mentions that experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) have worked with the villagers and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women to develop 55 internationally competitive prototypes for lifestyle products. This has enhanced the innovative abilities of the villagers, enabling them to produce internationally acceptable products.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker concludes by stating that similar PURA projects are needed across the country to bridge the rural-urban divide, with a goal of establishing 7000 such projects nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker shares two enriching experiences. First, they met over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan, where the farmers showed great interest in the various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the importance of agriculture, stating that it is the backbone of the nation and that the country needs to double its agricultural production with reduced resources. They propose the \"Seed to Food\" principle to improve economic conditions and empower farmers to protect and nurture the land for a second green revolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second experience is about a meeting with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man born without hands and legs, who despite his physical limitations, had a radiant smile and a positive attitude. He thanked God, his parents, teachers, and others for giving him confidence and training. When asked what he wanted, he simply said he wanted to sing in front of the speaker, which moved the speaker deeply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the importance of overcoming challenges and finding ways to give back to others. The speaker shares two personal experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Meeting a physically challenged individual who was talented in music, and despite his limitations, he wanted to share his gift with others. This story illustrates the power of positive attitude, perseverance, and the support of parents, teachers, and others in helping someone overcome adversity.\n",
      "2. Visiting a village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake. The speaker saw firsthand the resilience and courage of the people, who were working together to rebuild their community despite their losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The message of the speech is that with the right mindset and support, anyone can overcome challenges and make a positive impact on others. It highlights the importance of partnership and working together to overcome adversity and build a better future.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights the bravery and resilience of children and villagers in the face of natural disasters. The speaker shares two personal experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. During a visit to a village affected by an earthquake, they saw children and villagers participating in relief operations with the Armed Forces and interacting with them. They also witnessed the Chief Justice and State Government authorities settling relief grants for victims whose houses were damaged.\n",
      "2. In 2005, the speaker visited Car Nicobar Islands, which were affected by the 2004 Tsunami. They met Tribal Council Leaders, Students, and Children who had taken in affected victims as their own, showing remarkable courage. The speaker was moved by their story and composed a poem called \"Sea Waves\" which they sang with the villagers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also touches on the theme of connectivity for societal transformation, mentioning an address the speaker gave to the Pan African Parliament in 2004.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker proposed the concept of a Pan African e-Network, a seamless and integrated network connecting 53 African countries using satellite, fiber optics, and wireless technology, estimated to cost $100 million. The project aims to connect universities, hospitals, and tele-education/tele-medicine centers across Africa. A pilot project on tele-education and tele-medicine has already been commissioned in Ethiopia, where Indian and African universities and hospitals are collaborating.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech appears to be by the Prime Minister of India, highlighting several initiatives and accomplishments. Here's a summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Tele-consultation with African countries: The speaker mentions that India has been providing one-hour live tele-consultation to doctors in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa, in cardiology and radiology since November 2006, connecting Heads of State across the 53 African countries.\n",

He mentions the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which aims to empower young Indians to become leaders and contribute to the country's development.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the speech emphasizes India's achievements in technology, defense, and youth development, highlighting the country's commitment to progress and transformation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speaker is discussing the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which aims to transform young people into enlightened citizens. The foundation has been training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh, with notable improvements in self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and recognition of duties towards the nation. The speaker shares a personal anecdote about a student who used the training to help her father quit smoking. The speaker believes that the youth of India, who are the most powerful resource, need to be empowered through value-based education and leadership. The speech concludes by highlighting the cultural diversity and unity of India, and the importance of preserving and promoting these values.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's rich cultural and civilizational heritage while pursuing economic growth. The speaker believes that it is the duty of the current generation to protect and promote India's cultural treasures for future generations. The country has made significant progress in the past 60 years, with a strong and hardworking youth population of 540 million. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation before 2020 and empowers individuals to work towards this goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also outlines five key objectives for achieving a developed India 2020:\n",
